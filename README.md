# NowPlaying
A KDE Plasma widget inspired from the Cleartext rainmeter widget. Still in beta.

Hello,\
Our time here is brief and I won't waste what's left of it indulging in meaningless conversations. All I have to say is, the idea is totally lifted from https://github.com/redsaph/cleartext. I really liked it in Windows but despite that and a ton of other stuff that I had, windows was insufferable. I hate the monotony of my life enough that I don't want any more of it from my computer where I chose to spend a lot of my time.
Full credit to the guy there, I just made a clone.\
Now of course, it is not as feature fledged (read as no features) as that one but I aim to add most, if not all of it, if time permits.\
Feel free to open any issues, requests, suggestions etc.

Goodbye, for now, until then.\
Signing off,\
Ruinivist

PS: Don't forget to star the project. I care about fake internet points.
